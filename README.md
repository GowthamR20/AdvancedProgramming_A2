The main motive of this code is to understand the working of JavaFx.
JavaFx is a Java based UI development method.

In this program there are 3 posts - Event,Job,Sale with which the user can Edit, Create, Delete, Reply and view post.

Additionally there are few rules and conditions imposed on these posts as to who can access and who is responsible for editing and replying.
FutherMore,
Database access is also implemented.
JavaFx makes use of Java and hence JDBC is used.
Serialzation is another feature used to store and retrieve objects data from database and to write into them.
